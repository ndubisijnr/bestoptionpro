                            When most people think of investing, they typically envision buying stocks on the stock market, with many unaware of terms like options trading. Investing in stocks for long-term gains through a buy and hold strategy is a common approach, especially with guidance from a knowledgeable broker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, this strategy may not yield short-term gains. Many investors now opt for a more active investment style to pursue immediate returns. With the accessibility of online brokers, investors can easily execute transactions on stock exchanges, enabling more frequent buying and selling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, numerous individuals trade online either part-time or full-time, leveraging short-term price fluctuations. They may hold onto their purchases for just weeks, days, or even hours to ize on market�movements.

            <p class="">
                What makes trading options particularly intriguing is the ability to employ options spreads. While you can certainly profit by buying options and then selling them at a higher price, spreads offer even more powerful tools for trading. A spread occurs when you enter into positions on two or more options contracts based on the same underlying security, such as buying options on a specific stock while also writing contracts on the same stock.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are various types of spreads that you can create, each serving different purposes. Typically, spreads are used to either limit risk or reduce the financial outlay required for a position. Most options trading strategies involve the use of spreads, which can range from relatively simple to more complex approaches. However, even basic strategies can be effective and straightforward�to�understand.

                Selling &
                Writing Options

            <div class="">
                <p>
                    There are basically two ways in which you can sell options contracts. First, if you have previously bought contracts and wish to realize your profits, or cut your losses, then you would sell them by placing a sell to close order. The order is named as such because you are closing your position by selling options contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You would usually use that order if the options you owned had gone up in value and you wanted to take your profits at that point, or if the options you owned had fallen in value and you wanted to exit your position before incurring any other losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other way you can sell options is by opening a short position and short selling them. This is also known as writing options, because the process actually involves you writing new contracts to be sold in the market. When you do this you are taking on the obligation in the contract i.e. if the holder chooses to exercise their option then you would have to sell them the underlying security at the strike price (if a call option) or buy the underlying security from them at the strike price (if a put option).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing options is done by using the sell to open order, and you would receive a payment at the time of placing such an order. This is generally riskier than trading through buying and then selling, but there are profits to be made if you know what you are doing. You would usually place such an order if you believed the relevant underlying security would not move in such a way that the holder would be able to exercise their option�for�a�profit.
