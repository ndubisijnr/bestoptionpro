                Data from the Energy
                Information Administration (EIA) shows that natural gas was the second most widely fuel
                in the U.S., accounting for 32% of the energy consumption in 2021..
            </h5>
            <hr />
            <p>
                While petroleum was
                still the largest, it was used mostly for transportation purposes, as natural gas was
                the dominant fuel of choice in residential, industrial, and commercial use cases. Within
                the electricity sector, natural gas also led the pack and accounted for 32% of the total
                usage, and overall, natural gas accounted for 36% of the U.S. primary energy production.
                Finally, U.S. natural gas production also outstripped usage in 2021
            </p>
            <p>
                The top-performing oil and gas stocks in the past year include TORM PLC, Teekay Tankers,
                and Scorpio Tankers. Despite oil prices dropping significantly from their peaks recorded
                nearly a year ago, these companies have seen their shares rise by well over 100% in the
                past year, handily beating the 9% drop in the Russell 1000 Index.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            <p>
                Natural gas is
                turning out to be one of the
                more popular petroleum fuels in the world right now. This is because when compared to
                gasoline, diesel, or kerosene, natural gas produces far less carbon dioxide and few
                other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide.
            </p><p>
                This is part of the reason why the U.S. - one
                of the world's largest energy consumers - has shifted its energy production to natural
                gas in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while still exploiting the massive
                energy generation potential of petroleum products
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Oil and gas stocks as a group, measured by the benchmark Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF
                (XLE), have climbed by 10% in the past year, outperforming the broader market. However,
                declining oil and gas prices in the second half of 2022 and into 2023 could pressure
                margins and revenues in the sector.

    <h2>
        Advantages of Oil and Gas Stocks
    </h2>


    <div class="flexroll">
        <div class="note">
            <h4>
                Pros
            </h4>
            <p>
                Inflation/Interest Rates Hedge: Historically, rising inflation has been correlated with
                higher oil prices, offering investors a potential portfolio hedge by investing in oil
                and gas stocks. Typically, the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to tackle
                inflation, aiming to lower consumer demand. According to Bob Iaccino, co-founder of Path
                Trading Partners, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude contracts over the
                past six rate-tightening cycles has risen by an average of 16.06% six months after each
                rate hike.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tax Advantages: Investing in oil and gas stocks provides investors and producers with a
                range of unique tax benefits. Some key advantages include the favorable way active and
                passive income is treated and the deduction of certain drilling and lease costs. For
                instance, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code considers earnings from oil and
                gas royalties as passive income while categorizing net losses as active income. This may
                enable some investors to offset their production revenue losses from other forms of
                income, such as  gains.

                Cons
            </h4>
            <p>Being a very successful investment opportunity over the year, there are just a little disadvantages to investing in the oli and gas sector, such as;</p>
            <p>
                Swing trade positions are subject to overnight and weekend market risk.

            <p>
                Abrupt market reversals can result in substantial losses.

            <br>
            <p>
                Swing traders often miss longer-term trends in favor of short-term market moves.

                    Finally, the global natural gas market was estimated to be worth $955 billion in 2022
                    and will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% this year to be worth a
                    little over $1 trillion by the end of 2023 according to The Business Research Company.
                </p><p>
